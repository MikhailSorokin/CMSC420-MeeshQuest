Part 1: 
The AVL Tree source code was taken from Author Mark Allen Weiss, and modified by Mikhail Sorokin.
The link to it is here: http://users.cis.fiu.edu/~weiss/dsaajava/code/DataStructures/AvlTree.java.

This was his comment on the original file:
/*
 * Implements an AVL tree.
 * Note that all "matching" is based on the compareTo method.
 * @author Mark Allen Weiss
 */


Part 2: 

I am using pretty much all of the canonical, and modifying it to fit me
and to work for part 2.

As far as most AVLGTree functions, I heavily referenced them through this link with a similar AbstractMap implementation.
Thanks to Ivan, you da real MVP :):

I found the dijkstra algorithm from a student on the piazza post and modified it to fit my code.
